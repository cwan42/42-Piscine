Rush 00

Subject:
Take the first letter of the login of your team leader, convert it to a number following this rule:
A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4...

then your subject is the number you got modulo 5, so :
1 % 5 = 1 (your subject is 1)
2 % 5 = 2 (your subject is 2)
3 % 5 = 3 (your subject is 3)
4 % 5 = 4 (your subject is 4)
5 % 5 = 0 (your subject is 0)
6 % 5 = 1 (your subject is 1)
...

Our team leader is y, i.e. subject 0
Required files for submission: main.c , ft_putchar.c, rush0X.c

write the function rush taking two variables of type int as arguments, named respectively x and y. No need to say this function should be on the rush0X.c file.
Your function rush should display (on-screen) a rectangle of x characters for width, and y characters for length.

#### main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void  rush(int x, int y);

int   main(void)
{
      int x;
      int y;

      printf("Please enter two numbers separated by a space, for length and width of rectangle: ");
      scanf("%d %d", &x, &y); //no output cos' will mess up grading
      rush(x, y);
      return(0);
}

ft_putchar.c
#include <unistd.h>
void  ft_putchar(char c)
{
      write(1, &c, 1);
}

rush00.c
void ft_putchar(char c);

void rush(int x, int y)
{
      int W;
      int L;

      L = 1;
      while (L <= y && x > 0)
      {
            W = 1;
            while (W <= x)
            {
                  if          (W != 1 && W != x) && (L == 1 || L == y)
                              ft_putchar('-');
                  else if     (L != 1 && L != y) && (W == 1 || W == x)
                              ft_putchar('|');
                  else if     ((W == 1 || W == x) || (L == 1 || L == y))
                              ft_putchar('o');
                  else        
                              ft_putchar(' ');
                  W++;
            }
            ft_putchar('\n');
            L++;
      }
}
